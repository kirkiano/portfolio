# On this portfolio

It turns out that the idea behind [separation of
concerns](separation_of_concerns.md) is illustrated by this very repo. As a
software developer you have the option of serving your portfolio from your own
personally maintained website. But that would entail the unrelated work of
keeping the system's software up-to-date, periodically upgrading to the latest
versions of third-party dependencies, trying out new features, debugging,
managing the cloud platform, _etc_. All this is _separate_ from the actual task
of presenting a portfolio and can therefore be pursued as a separate project.
It can also get in the way at the most inconvenient time: should the portfolio
system falter or fail during, say, a critical job search, you would be burdened
with extra stress during an already stressful time.
