# On this portfolio

It turns out that [separation of concerns](separation_of_concerns.md) is
illustrated by this very repo. As a software developer you have the option of
serving your portfolio from your own personally maintained website. But that
would entail the _unrelated_ work of keeping the system's software up to date,
periodically upgrading to the latest versions of third-party dependencies,
trying out new features, debugging, managing the cloud platform, _etc_. All
this is _separate_ from the actual task of presenting a portfolio; it can be
pursued as a separate project. It can also get in the way at the most
inconvenient time: should the website suffer difficulties during a job search
for example, you would be burdened with extra stress during a critical time.
