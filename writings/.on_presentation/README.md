# On Presentation

Here I begin to collect examples of ways in which presentations might be
improved. I hope to show that the reasons why a presentation might be good or
bad are largely objective, *ie*, often not just a matter of taste or cultural
difference.

Please be aware that I myself have given poor presentations, for the same
reason that other sincere and well-meaning people do: I wasn't aware of certain
rules and standards of public speaking. I hope to convince you that they apply
as well, if not more, to the homemade video or the YouTube vlog.

Let's hope that by raising this kind of awareness, we can help each other
present material more clearly and considerately. It would make the world a
better place. :wink:
