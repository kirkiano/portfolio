# On Presentation

Here I hope to collect examples of infelicitous habits of presentation. My aim
is to show that the reasons why a presentation might be good or bad are largely
objective. They're usually not just a matter of taste or cultural difference.

Please be aware that in the past I myself have given poor presentations, for
the same reason that many people still do today, namely, that I wasn't even
aware of certain rules and standards of public speaking, and that they apply
even more urgently to such things as the homemade video or the YouTube vlog.

Let's hope that by raising awareness about this problem, we can all help each
other present material more clearly and considerately. It would make the world
a better place. :wink:
